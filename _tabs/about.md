With over twenty years of experience in transportation and security, I am passionate about pursuing a career in cybersecurity with Coursera and Google. I have completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate issued by Google Career Certificates and Cousera, and I am currently enrolled in the Microsoft Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate course offered by Microsoft and Coursera. I am eager to learn new skills and apply them to real-world scenarios, and I am motivated by the challenge and opportunity of protecting data and systems from cyber threats.

In my previous role as a CDL A Truck Driver at TLI - Transco Lines, Inc., I delivered exceptional service and safety standards, driving over 5,000 miles per week across multiple states. I demonstrated strong communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, working with my partner and the dispatch team to coordinate routes, schedules, and cargo. I also used Microsoft Excel to track and report fuel consumption, mileage, and expenses. I am confident that I can leverage my skills and experience to contribute to Coursera's mission of providing high-quality and accessible online education.
